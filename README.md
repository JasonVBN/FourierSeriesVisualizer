# FourierSeriesVisualizer

Draws a Fourier series!

Imagine this: a point $a_1$ orbits around the origin with radius $r_1$ and angular velocity $\omega_1$. Another point $a_2$ orbits around $a_1$ with its own radius and angular velocity. Point $a_3$ orbits around point $a_2$ and so on... and the final point traces out a path.

By changing the radii and angular velocities, you can draw anything.

(got the idea to make my own Fourier simulator while watching this video)

Dependencies: PyGame, NumPy, time
